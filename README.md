# Weather-Dashboard

For this particular repository, I have developed a live and functioning weather dashboard. In this particular project, my objectives and goals were to be able to create a viable weather gathering function that was to retrieve data from another API (application program interface). In this instance the data we are retrieving in this application is coming directly from the OpenWeatherMap API. 

In this app specifically, the user will be able to generate a 5-day weather outlook for any city that they choose. When they enter the city into the search bar, they are presented with conditions that give the City Name and date of the time they are searching along with an icon that represents the current and future weather conditions, temperature, humidity percentage and wind speed. 

Even after a new city has been searched by the user, the searched cities will remain on a list under the search section- if the user clicks on any of the cities, her or she will be able to see that city's forecast. 

Thank you,
Chris Turton
